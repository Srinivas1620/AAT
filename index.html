        <p>Sooo let thee cringeee cheeeezinessssss begin igg!!
Alsoooo Im doing all this in laptop anmata, Sooo cant use emojisss!!
</p>
<p>
Aaaa dialougeee vinnnaaavaaaaaaa!! Ammayiluuu padeyadammmm andhammmm, mem padipodaaammm aanavaayithiiii!!!
It Mightttt Soundddd very Misooogynisticcc but its nott!!
Sooo what im trying to sayyy isss, whyyy shoulddd a girlll say all thiss when a guy is alreadyyy present right there!!
</p>
<p>
I never ever thought ill say all these things to a woman!!
I mean for god's sake!! I had the next 30-40 years planned kiii What would i do being single and all, I was sooo determined and confident kiii i would lead such a great single life kiii I would regret nothing at all, I had no second thoughts about that!!
Maybe all this, its tooo soon, idk, But if i dont say this now, then i dont know when i will!
</p>
<p>
Do you know what i feel?? 
I read a posttt kiiii I fell for her soul and mind before i even know how the touch of her finger might feel like!
There might a million problems and stressful things in my head, but just talking to you about random stuff kinda gives me the courage/ hope kii i can face them in a much moreee confident way!!
Do you know why You? and not deekshitha or some other random person on the planet??
You see, Qualities chuskodam, compatibility chuskodam, idantha okay, fine eyy, but the thing issss!!! likeeeeee i can sayyy to u the mosttt complex thinggg in the world, and ull get it!! i can say u how i feel in the most absurd way possible and still u get it! At this pointttt i really dont think ki its about the qualities and features anymore, its really just about how well we connect and understand each other maybe. And idk about you but, i feel ki, its very very very rare kiii two people connect like thattt!! 
Talking about the past and all, I already told you kadhaaaaa, an year ago and all, i just thought we might be compatible emo, but thats just seeing things on the surfaceee!! But the last couple of weeks, when i started digging that surface, i realized so many things! likeee it wasn't justtt compatibility! the constant forgiveness we both had, the constant patience and adjustments!! and the goddamnnnn connect we both had!! Its not at all common man!!
I never everrr takes risks at all, Likeeee nenuuu naa eyes thoo i saw a million guys, saying kiii areyyy my woman is different ra blah blah blah, lasttt kiii paaapam aneee stage lokiii velthadu vaadu. I was always in that mindset only, but right now, idkkkk..........I trust you sooo fucking much, I trust all this soooo fucking much, Evenn theee coincidences and all!! Theyyyy Donttt justtt happen likeee thattt to anyoneee!!
There areee likeee million songs that i can say, where the lyrics say kii ""**THIS**"", andharikiii dorkadhuuuu, Vethikeeee vaaluuuu vethukuthunee untaru and  dorkina vaalakii emooo vaaalu entha lucky ooooo realize avvaru and all.
</p>

<p>
THIS IS NOT NORMAL!
</p>
<p>
I REALLY DONT FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP, I FEEL KIII THIS IS MUCH MOREEE PURE THAN SUCH CASUAL WALA THING. I SAW COUPLES WHO HAVE BEEN COUPLES SINCE LIKE 3-4 YEARS AND ALWAYS MISUNDERSTAND EACH OTHER EVERY 2-3 DAYS.
</p>
<p>
What im trying to tell you is, idk how u see it, but for me, THIS isnt JUST a relationship or something else, It just feels too fucking pure to be that silly bf gf wala thing, I really feel kii this can go beyond that with time, patience and efforts.
</p><p>
Inthaaa intense and wildd thoughts i never say it to anyone, because maybe its just me who sees things that wayy!! But idhiii ippudu neeku cheppaka potheyy idkkkk where this will go and all!!</p>
